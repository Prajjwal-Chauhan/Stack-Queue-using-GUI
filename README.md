# Stack-Queue-using-GUI
This program uses GUI for Stack and Queue implementation and some action listeners text-fields and buttons etc.;.

Project : Program using JCF to achieve the following: 

A program that randomly stores 10 integer numbers (to start with) in a LinkedList object.  Using this LinkedList object, implementing stack and queue operations using GUI as follows: Added 2 Radio Buttons for choosing options (a) Stack and (b) Queue, and 4 JButtons (Push, Pop for Stack, and Add, Delete for Queue).

Once the program is exxecuted, it will display a LinkedList of 10 random integers in a text field. We would then be able to choose a radio button of either Stack or Queue, followed by one of its operations (Push or Pop Buttons for Stack ONLY, and Add or Delete Buttons for Queue ONLY (Invalid choices like choosing Stack followed by pressing ADD button will not work).  The program then display the modified list ( as per the operation undertaken) in the text field. 


<!-- Note: In case you think you may not be able to implement the GUI, then use JOptionPane to enter your commands (as shown below), and show the resultant Linked List in the console.     -->
The commands to be entered in showInputDialogue will be as follows: -->

Push 
Pop  
Add 
Delete

Also the original list randomly generated in one text field and applied the beforesaid operations on the resultant text field.

Program also uses a clear() function in order to clear the actionlistners applied before the current operation.

Note that Stack is a LIFO (Last in first out) structure, and Queue is a FIFO (First in first out) structure.
